#### Goals and opportunities
The goal of the course is to improve programming and problem solving skills of the students by facing them with difficult problems and by presenting the techniques that help their reasoning in the implementation of correct and efficient solutions.
The importance of these skills has been recognized by the most important software companies worldwide, which evaluate candidates in their job interviews mostly by the ability in addressing such difficult problems (e.g., see [here](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-preparation/)).

A natural goal is to involve the students in the intellectual pleasure of programming and problem solving, also preparing them for the most important international online contests, such as [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/), [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) and so on, for internships in most important companies and their interviews.
A desirable side-effect of the course could be to organize and prepare teams of students for online contests.

The course will provide the opportunity of:

* facing with challenging algorithmic problems;
* improving problem solving and programming skills;
* getting in touch with some big companies for internships, scholarships, or thesis proposals.

<br>
#### Exam
You have two choices for the exam:

- **Option 1:** Submit your solutions for the three hands-on assignments within the specified deadlines for each assignment.

- **Option 2:** Submit your solutions for the three hands-on assignments, along with all the mandatory exercises, at a time that suits you. You can find the mandatory exercises highlighted in bold within the lecture materials provided below.

In either case, you will be required to participate in an oral examination covering all the topics covered in our course. You can schedule this oral exam by appointment.

Please note that all solutions must be written in Rust.

You have the opportunity to earn additional points through:

- **Active Participation:** Actively engage in class discussions and activities.

- **Serious Participation in Online Contests:** Engage seriously in online programming contests such as CodeForces, TopCoder, HackerRank, Google Code Jam, and more.

- **Successful Interviews with Major Companies:** Achieving success in interviews with prominent companies.

It is highly recommended that you implement solutions for the problems presented in each lecture. This practice not only enhances your problem-solving skills but also provides valuable Rust programming experience.

I recommend creating a [Github](http://github.com) repository to centralize all your solutions and their corresponding descriptions. This repository can be set to either private or public visibility, ensuring that I can access it in either case. Please share the repository link with me, and make sure to keep it regularly updated so that I can monitor your progress effectively.

#### How to solve a problem

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to effectively solve a problem:

- **Read the Problem Description:** Begin by carefully reading the problem statement. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of what the problem is asking you to solve.
- **Understand with Examples:** Examine any provided examples. Use these examples to validate your understanding of the problem's requirements and constraints.
- **Design a Trivial Solution:** Start by designing a straightforward and naive solution to the problem. This is often referred to as a brute-force approach. It may not be the most efficient solution, but it helps you get started and ensures that you have a working solution.
- **Brainstorm for Efficiency:** Once you have a working solution, think about how you can optimize it. Consider different algorithms, data structures, and strategies that might lead to a more efficient solution. Use running examples to help you visualize and refine your approach.
- **Seek Help and Hints:** If you're stuck and unable to find a more efficient solution, don't hesitate to seek help. Discuss the problem with other students, ask questions in the group, or consult resources like your course materials, relevant websites, or textbooks. Gathering hints and insights from others is a valuable part of the learning process.
- **Document Your Solution:** Write a brief description of your chosen solution in English. Explain the logic behind it and provide an analysis of its time and space complexity. This documentation helps you clarify your thought process and is valuable for future reference.
- **Implement Your Solution:** Write the code for your solution in Rust. Ensure that your code follows the algorithm you've designed and documented.
- **Test and Debug:** Submit your implementation to the problem's platform or testing environment. Work on debugging and refining your code until it passes all the tests and produces correct results.
- **Compare Solutions:** Always compare your solution and implementation with existing ones if available. This can help you learn different approaches and best practices for solving similar problems.
- **Iterate and Learn:** Solving problems is a learning process. Don't be discouraged if you encounter difficulties. Keep practicing, learning from your mistakes, and applying new techniques to improve your problem-solving skills.

By following these steps, you can systematically approach problem-solving tasks and increase your proficiency in tackling a wide range of challenges.

#### Background <a name="Background"></a>
If you're looking to brush up on your understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, I highly recommend delving into the renowned book [Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11866) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein.
