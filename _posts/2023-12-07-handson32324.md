This is the text of third hands-on of the the course [*Competitive Programming and Contests*](competitive/) at University of Pisa in the accademic year 2023-24.

The objective of this hands-on is to play with Dynamic Programming in Rust. There are two problems to solve.

<br>
#### Problem #1: Holiday Planning
As the last hands-on of your class is due to two weeks after Christmas, you are ready to plan your Christmas holiday traveling around Europe, to visit different cities. You have a tour guide to Europe, which presents a different itinerary for each city. Each itinerary specifies how many different attractions can be visited per day. As an example, this is the itinerary for Florence

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
     Day & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
     \midrule
     number of  attractions& 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This means that if you spend two days in Florence you will have the chance to visit $3 + 2 = 5$ different attractions. You want to visit as many attractions as you can, considering that you only have a limited number of days on vacation before the oral exam. Your task is to write a program to organize your holiday. Note that you can visit the attractions in the order provided by the guide, meaning that if you spend one day in Florence you will visit $3$ attractions (i.e., you cannot "cherry pick" the $4$ attractions of the last day).

You are provided with the number of attractions you can visit for each of the $D$ days, in each city. The number of cities is $n$. Your goal is to identify the maximum number of attractions the tourist can visit. The time complexity of your solution should be $O(nD^2)$.

[Here](/rossano/assets/zip/Testset_handson3_2324_p1.zip) we have a set of tests with the following format.

##### Input
The first line contains $n$ and $D$. Then, the following $n$ lines contain each $D$ different integer values and describe the itineraries $I$.

##### Output
The maximum number of attractions that you can visit.


##### Example
The input is 

```
2 3      // D 
3 2 1    // Florence
3 1 1    // London
```
  
The output is 
```
8  // 2 days in Florence, 1 day in London
```

#### Problem #2: Is There

You are given $$n$$ segments. A segment $$\langle l, r\rangle$$ is such that $$0 \leq l \leq r \leq n-1$$. Then, you are given $$m$$ queries `IsThere`. 

A query `IsThere(i,j,k)` has to return $$1$$ if there exists a position $$p$$, with $$0 \leq i \leq p \leq j \leq n-1$$, such that *exactly* $$k$$ segments contain position $$p$$, $$0$$ otherwise.

The solution must run in $$O((n+m)\log n)$$ time.

[Here](/rossano/assets/zip/Testset_handson2_2324_p2.zip) we have a set of tests with the following format.

##### Input
The first line contains $$n$$ and $$m$$.
Each of the next $$n$$ lines contains a pair integers $$\langle l, r\rangle$$, one for each segment.
Finally, there will be $$m$$ lines, one for each query. Each of these lines contains $$i$$, $$j$$ and $$k$$, separated by a space.

##### Output
The result of each query in input order.

##### Example

```
5 4    // n m
0 4    // segments
1 3
1 2
1 1
0 0
0 4 4   // i j k
0 4 0
1 3 1
1 4 1
```

The output is
```
1
0
0
1
```

#### Submission
Submit the main files, a file `lib.rs`, and a file `Handson_3_solution_YOUR_NAME.pdf` to [rossano.venturini@gmail.com](mailto:rossano.venturini@gmail.com) by 06/01/2024.

The report `Handson_3_solution_YOUR_NAME.pdf` briefly describes your solutions, your implementations, and an analysis of their time and space complexities. Add references to any relevant source you consulted to find your solutions or to develop their implementations.

Before submitting your solutions,
- make sure your implementation successfully passes all the tests.
- use `cargo fmt` to format your code.
- use `cargo clippy` to check your code.
- use [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) to improve your English and avoid [tpyos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tpyo#English) :-). There is an [extension for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.grammarly).

<br>
#### Cheating
**Very important!** You are allowed to verbally discuss solutions with other students, **BUT** you must implement all solutions by yourself. Therefore, sharing implementations with others is strictly **forbidden**.
